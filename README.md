 * Interactive tutorials: https://groklearning.com/learn/hoc-epidemic/intro/0/ http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python
 * Read tutorial: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/

Homework (Due 9/10 before class):
 * Complete the interactive python tutorials Grok Learning "HOC: Disease Epidemic" and codecademy Python. Which one worked for you?  How did this compare to the R tutorials.  Did you use something else (the python.org tutorial)? If so please elaborate. Did you comlete the entire tutorial to complete the second homework or just portions.  Submit to A2_BasicPython.
 * Write a program to read a csv file with two columns (x1 and x2) and write a csv with the following columns: x1, x2, x1+x2, x2-x1. Import the data into R and plot x1 v.s. x2.  Submit to A3_PythonCSV

### Week 3 (Project and source management) ###
